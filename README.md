# <a name="main"></a>Veridia Tabletop RPG

Veridia is the name of an imaginary world. All began in the mid 2010s when a little indie videogame was made: [Veridia Tactics](https://trisfald.itch.io/veridia-tactics). Being inspired by great tactical titles of the past, the game has a heavy focus on strategy and planning. Nonetheless, great care had been put into the world building process; a part of its potentialities as a fantasy setting were already perceivable, yet at that time much work had still to be done.

The next step saw a change in the medium, going from a videogame to a book. The opera, titled *Veridia*, is a setting manual describing a much more refined world. It could very well be considered as the full expression of the ideas previously pioneered by Veridia Tactics. A free copy is available [here](https://github.com/Trisfald/veridia-book) or as a [free epub](https://books2read.com/b/mY1OaV?edit=maybe-later&store=null). However, it's by no means the finishing line: countless details and stories awaits to be created.

The Veridia Tabletop RPG is born to give people the possibility to leverage Veridia's lore in order to create and experience their own adventures. Reading the setting manual or having played the videogame is not strictly required to start an adventure, but it'll greatly enhance the campaign, so give it a try! 

Characteristics:
- detailed fantasy setting (late medieval, low to mid magic)
- one roll per character's turn is enough
- combat can be deadly
- classless, leveless system
- balanced focus on combat and social interactions
